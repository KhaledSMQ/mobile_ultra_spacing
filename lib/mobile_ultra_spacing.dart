/// A comprehensive library for advanced responsive spacing, breakpoint management,
/// and optical adjustments in Flutter applications.
///
/// This library acts as a central export point for various utilities designed
/// to create highly optimized and visually consistent UIs across a wide range
/// of screen sizes and resolutions.
///
/// It exports:
/// - `breakpoints.dart`: Defines screen breakpoints and provides tools for responsive layouts based on them.
/// - `optical_adjustments.dart`: (Content not provided) Presumably contains utilities for fine-tuning visual spacing and alignment.
/// - `spacing_utils.dart`: Offers optimized spacing constants, responsive spacing values, and utility widgets.
